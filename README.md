# chaaart

Turn your **json** encoded data into an awesome chart PNG.

chaaart uses [Google Chart API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and [quiche](https://github.com/ryanrolds/quiche).

## install
At the moment chaaart is not ready no be npm'able. So you must download the source and run `$ npm install -g` in order to use it from the CLI (you may need to run it with `sudo`), or you just simply run it with node `$node chaaart.js [options]`;

## usage

`$ chaaart --chart line --title Rainbow --json data.json --output chart.png`

There's also an alternative way to run chaaart with `$ node chaaart.js [options]`

You can customize your chart with the many options chaaart provides

```
  -h, --help            output usage information
  -V, --version         output the version number

  -t, --title [value]   Add chart title
  -c, --chart <value>   Add chart type [line|bar|pie|qr]
  -o, --output <value>  Output file name
  -j, --json <value>    Input file name
```
**note:** At the moment chaaart only supports **line chart**.

## example

Given the following json (sample.json):

```json
{
  "data": [
      {
        "values": [1000, 1500, 2000, 1300, 5000, 4300, 800, 1000, 2500, 2200, 2000, 2000],
        "legend": "kWh",
        "color": "4e4e99"
      },
      {
        "values": [600, 846, 359, 9045, 1900, 6528, 4080, 3127, 6657, 4627],
        "legend": "$",
        "color": "86d969"
      },
      {
        "values": [3792, 8848, 8426, 8413, 5115, 1664, 4864, 4367, 5166, 1999],
        "legend": "m2",
        "color": "e8716b"
    }
  ],
  "xAxisLabels": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Ago", "Sep", "Nov", "Dec"]
}
```

running `$chaaart --title Rainbow --chart line --json sample.json --output chart.png` will output
